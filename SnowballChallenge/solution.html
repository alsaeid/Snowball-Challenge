				<p id="text">
				Enor is a state funded and operated company that produces green energy. We work and build solutions for
					all aspects of green energy.<br><br>
					This is the 73rd company that Norway holds interest in. After making billions of dollars in oil production
					it is time to make good use of the money. That is why Enor was founded. It is a company largely owned
					by the Norwegian State made to serve the Norwegian StateÂ´s interests. The company specializes in
					production of solar panels, windmills, water-power and it has crucial technology in nuclear-power.
					Abroad the company acts like any other public company, selling its solutions and serving the market.
					<br><br>
				Enor - the new era of Norwegian power production.
